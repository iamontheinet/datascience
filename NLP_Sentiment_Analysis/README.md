# Natural Language Processing -- Sentiment Analysis

Social netoworks and media platforms are challenged with effectively facilitating open conversations. This results in many such communities preventing users from expressing their opinions, giving feedback etc. on their platform. On the other hand, in open forums the possibility of being verbally abused and harrassed by strangers online is not a great motivator for people to engage and learn from one another's perspectives.
